</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Terminology

**Legal** = in accordance to societal laws
  - systematic body of rules governing society; set through government
  - punishment for violation

**Ethical** = following moral principles of tradition, group, or individual
  - branch of philosophy, science of a standard human conduct
  - professional ethics = rules codified by professional organization
  - no legal binding, no enforcement beyond "shame"
  - high ethical standards may yield long term benefits through image and staff loyalty

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Big Disclaimer

Legality is obviously a locale-specific concern.

What is _ethical_ (and how we know) is a very complicated question.
* Whether there exists ground-truth ethics is a point of philosophical debate. 
* Often informed by context/culture/etc.

We adopt a generally US-centric perspective for much of this discussion. 
* ...Because that's where we are.
* But given the global reach of software, tread with care.

<aside class="notes"><p>GDPR is an easy example</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## With a few lines of code...

Developers have substantial power in shaping products, and software has substantial power over human lives. 

Small design decisions can have substantial impact (safety, security,
discrimination, ...) -- not always deliberate

Our view: We have both **legal & ethical** responsibilities to anticipate mistakes,
think through their consequences, and build in mitigations!

![](gender-bias.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Loan lending: Gender discrimination is illegal.
* Medical related: Gender-specificity may be desirable (women generally pay less for life insurance than men, since they tend to live longer.)
* Discrimination is a __domain-specific__ concept 
  - ML models discriminate based on input data by construction. 
  - There are real differences between two groups, it might not be fair to ignore them
  - The problem is _unjustified_ differentiation; i.e., discriminating on factors that should not matter
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Fairness vs. bias vs. harm

Fairness is best understood as a **societal or cultural concept**.

Bias, in discussing ML, can be understood as a **technological or algorithmic
concept**; it is often discussed in terms of its negative effects.
* Whether bias is harmful or unfair is not something that can be decided algorithmically.

Useful definition/framework defines algorithmic bias as "a skew that produces a
type of harm."

*Data reflects past biases, not intended outcomes*

<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

*Should the algorithm reflect reality?*

<aside class="notes"><p>&quot;An example of this type of bias can be found in a 2018 image search
result where searching for women CEOs ultimately resulted in fewer female CEO images due
to the fact that only 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were woman—which would cause the search
results to be biased towards male CEOs. These search results were of course reflecting
the reality, but whether or not the search algorithms should reflect this reality is an issue worth
considering.&quot;</p>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Tainted Labels

*Bias in dataset labels assigned (directly or indirectly) by humans*

![](amazon-hiring.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Example: Hiring decision dataset -- labels assigned by (possibly biased) experts or derived from past (possibly biased) hiring decisions 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Skewed Sample

*Bias in how and what data is collected*

![](crime-map.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Crime prediction: Where to analyze crime? What is considered crime? Actually a random/representative sample?

Raw data is an oxymoron
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Limited Features

*Features that are less informative/reliable for certain subpopulations*

![](performance-review.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Graduate admissions: Letters of recommendation equally reliable for international applicants?
* Employee performance review: "Leave of absence" acceptable feature if parental leave is gender skewed?


<aside class="notes"><p>Decisions may be based on features that are predictive and accurate for a large part of the target distribution, but not so for some other parts of the distribution. 
For example, a system ranking applications for graduate school admissions may heavily rely on letters of recommendation and be well calibrated for applicants who can request letters from mentors familiar with the culture and jargon of such letters in the US, but may work poorly for international applicants from countries where such letters are not common or where such letters express support with different jargon. To reduce bias, we should be carefully reviewing all features and analyze whether they may be less predictive for certain subpopulations.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Sample Size Disparity

*Limited training data for some subpopulations*

![](shirley-card.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Biased sampling process: "Shirley Card" used for Kodak color calibration, using mostly Caucasian models
* Small subpopulations: Sikhs small minority in US (0.2%) barely represented in a random sample
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Sample Size Disparity

Without intervention:
* Models biased toward populations more represented in target distribution (e.g., Caucasian skin tones)
* ... biased towards population that are easier to sample (e.g., people self-selecting to post to Instagram)
* ... may ignore small minority populations as noise

Typically requires deliberate sampling strategy, intentional oversampling

*Features correlate with protected attribute, remain after removal*
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

![](neighborhoods.png)
