* Critique regulation and self-regulation approaches in ethical machine learning

* accountability, responsibility, liability, and culpability all overlap in common use
* often about assigning *blame* -- responsible for fixing or liable for paying for damages
  * liability, culpability have *legal* connotation
  * responsibility tends to describe *ethical* aspirations
  * accountability often defined as oversight relationship, where actor is accountable to some "forum" that can impose penalties
  * see also legal vs ethical earlier

![Random letters](../_assets/onterminology.jpg)<!-- .element: class="cornerimg" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Terminology

Academic definition of accountability:

> A relationship between an **actor** and a **forum**,
in which the actor has an obligation to explain
and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can
pose questions and pass judgement, and the
actor **may face consequences**.

That is accountability implies some oversight with ability to penalize
