* Test with *any* test data, e.g., purely random data or existing test data

*Testing of anti-classification barely needed, because easy to ensure by constructing during training or inference!*

* Anti-classification is a good starting point to think about protected attributes
* Useful baseline for comparison
* Easy to implement, but only effective if (1) no proxies among features
and (2) protected attributes add no predictive power

* Anti-classification (fairness through blindness)

* Equalized odds (separation)
* ...and numerous others and variations!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group fairness

Key idea: Outcomes matter, not accuracy!

Compare outcomes across two groups
* Similar rates of accepted loans across racial/gender groups?
* Similar chance of being hired/promoted between gender groups?
* Similar rates of (predicted) recidivism across racial groups?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Disparate impact vs. disparate treatment

Disparate treatment: Practices or rules that treat a certain protected
group(s) differently from others
* e.g., Apply different mortgage rules for people from different backgrounds 

Disparate impact: Neutral rules, but outcome is worse for
 one or more protected groups
* Same rules are applied, but certain groups have a harder time
  obtaining mortgage in a particular neighborhood 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group fairness in discrimination law

Relates to *disparate impact* and the four-fifth rule

Can sue organizations for discrimination if they 
* mostly reject job applications from one minority group (identified by protected classes) and hire mostly from another
* reject most loans from one minority group and more frequently accept applicants from another

<div class="small">

> Four-fifths rule: If the selection rate for a protected group is less than 80% of the selection rate for the group with the highest selection rate, there is adverse impact.

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Notation

* $X$: Feature set (e.g., age, race, education, region, income, etc.,)  
* $A \in X$: Sensitive attribute (e.g., gender)
* $R$: Regression score (e.g., predicted likelihood of on-time loan payment)
* $Y'$: Classifier output
  * $Y' = 1$ if and only if $R > T$ for some threshold $T$
  * e.g., Grant the loan ($Y' = 1$) if the likelihood of paying back > 80% 
* $Y$: Target variable being predicted ($Y = 1$ if the person actually
  pays back on time)

> $P[Y' = 1 | A = a]  = P[Y' = 1 | A = b]$

* Also called _independence_ or _demographic parity_
* Mathematically, $Y' \perp A$
  * Prediction ($Y'$)  must be independent of the sensitive attribute ($A$)
* Examples:
	* The predicted rate of recidivism is the same across all races
	* Both women and men have the equal probability of being promoted
		* i.e., P[promote = 1 | gender = M] = P[promote = 1 | gender = F]

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group Fairness Limitations

What are limitations of group fairness?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group Fairness Limitations

* Ignores possible correlation between $Y$ and $A$
  * Rules out perfect predictor $Y' = Y$ when $Y$ & $A$ are correlated!
* Permits abuse and laziness: Can be satisfied by randomly assigning    a positive outcome ($Y' = 1$) to protected groups
	* e.g., Randomly promote people (regardless of their
      job performance) to match the rate across all groups

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Adjusting Thresholds for Group Fairness

Select different classification thresholds ($t_0$, $t_1$) for different groups (A = 0,  A = 1) to achieve group fairness, such that 
> $P[R > t_0 | A = 0]  = P[R > t_1 | A = 1]$

<div class="small">

> Example: Mortgage application
>  * R: Likelihood of paying back the loan on time

>	* P[R > 0.8 | A = 0] = 0.4,  P[R > 0.8 | A = 1] = 0.7
>  * Adjust thresholds to achieve group fairness

Wouldn't group A = 1 argue it's unfair? When does this type of adjustment make sense?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Group Fairness

*How would you test whether a classifier achieves group fairness?*

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Group Fairness

Collect realistic, representative data (not randomly generated!)
* Use existing validation/test data
* Monitor production data
* (Somehow) generate realistic test data, e.g. from probability distribution of population

Separately measure the rate of positive predictions
* e.g., P[promoted = 1 | gender = M],      P[promoted = 1 | gender = F] = ?

Report issue if the rates differ beyond some threshold $\epsilon$ across
groups

Key idea: Focus on accuracy (not outcomes) across two groups

* Similar default rates on accepted loans across racial/gender groups?
* Similar rate of "bad hires" and "missed stars" between gender groups?
* Similar accuracy of predicted recidivism vs actual recidivism across racial groups?

Accuracy matters, not outcomes!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Equalized odds in discrimination law

Relates to *disparate treatment*

Typically, lawsuits claim that protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) were used in decisions even though they were irrelevant
* e.g., fired over complaint because of being Latino, whereas other White employees were not fired with similar complaints

Must prove that the defendant had *intention* to discriminate
* Often difficult: Relying on shifting justifications, inconsistent application of rules, or explicit remarks overheard or documented
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Equalized odds

$P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$
$P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$

Statistical property of *separation*: $Y' \perp A | Y$

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Review: Confusion Matrix

![](confusion-matrix.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Can we explain separation in terms of model errors?
* $P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$
* $P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Separation

$P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$ (FPR parity)

$P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$ (FNR parity)

* $Y' \perp A | Y$: Prediction must be independent of the sensitive attribute
    _conditional_ on the target variable
* i.e., All groups are susceptible to the same false positive/negative rates
* Example: Y': Promotion decision, A: Gender of applicant: Y: Actual job performance

* Fairness is a system-level property

* Fairness-aware data collection, fairness testing for training data
* Identifying blind spots
